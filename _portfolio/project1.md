The Digital Education & Safety Foundation developed a fork of the Scratch 3.0 coding platform which included software extensions for generating NFTs for their fundraising program. The Foundation is working to get the changes merged into the main codebase. The fork is hosted by the foundation and is available free for use here: <a href="https://scratch.digitaleducationsafety.org">https://scratch.digitaleducationsafety.org</a>.
