## Educational STEM/STEAM Apps: Enhancing STEM/STEAM Skills

Curated collections of STEM/STEAM apps have transformed the way we learn and engage with STEM/STEAM subjects. By offering interactive, visual, and multisensory experiences, these apps empower learners to develop critical skills such as problem-solving, critical thinking, and hands-on experimentation. As technology continues to evolve, curated STEM app collections stand as a valuable resource in nurturing a generation of STEM-literate individuals prepared to tackle the challenges and advancements of the future.
